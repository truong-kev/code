<h1> Our Project was created using the turtle tool in python. The turtle tool allowed us to have images all work together to create a game that was similar to Alien Invaders. Our goal was to create a game that was similar to that but with added features. Some of the features we added is the ability for the spaceship to not be restrained to only left and right movement, and cool little additions like an explosion on impact. We also created object that you don't want to hit otherwise you would lose points.

<h1> Our Project was created once more primarily the usage of the turtle tool in Python. We set the images of the 3 different characters being the Goomba, Bowser, and Mario andset them to interact with each other. The objective of the game we created is to have a game where you control Mario, and you want to try and go down and "stomp" on the goombas just like the mechanic in the real game. This earns you a point. However, to add some sort of obstacle into our game we included a Bowser that comes at you that you have to consistently dodge, otherwise you will lose.

<h1> Our project was created once more using Python. We set our turtles to either the spaceship, astroids, or stars. The purpose of our game was to create a "space race" in which one would try to collect 3 stars that are scattered around in the box, and "pick" them up. Once you picked up all of them, you would go and try and cross the finish line, while avoiding the moving astroids during all of this. There is a timer so you can see yourself improve overtime, or try and get a personal best.

<h1> This time instead of using Python, we used Scratch. Our group created an Undertale themed storyline in which you started off as the main character in which you go and explored and fall through a hole into an underground world. It has input to interact with your name and "talk" to you, and when you fall down the hole you reach an area in which you get a headband, and then you can go around and explore until reaching the end area at a door.
