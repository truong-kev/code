<h1> Our Project was created using the turtle tool in python. The turtle tool allowed us to have images all work together to create a game that was similar to Alien Invaders. Our goal was to create a game that was similar to that but with added features. Some of the features we added is the ability for the spaceship to not be restrained to only left and right movement, and cool little additions like an explosion on impact. We also created object that you don't want to hit otherwise you would lose points.
